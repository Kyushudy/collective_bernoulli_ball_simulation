This code accompanies our project on the simulation of the collective Bernoulli-Ball system. It contains the model of simulation, the record of optimization process, and results of optimized simulator.

To run the samples of simulation, use /simulation_code/sim_1balloon_test.m, /simulation_code/sim_2balloon_test.m, /simulation_code/sim_4balloon_test.m for 1,2,4-balloon system seperately.
To run model optimisation, use /simulation_code/optimiseB1.m, /simulation_code/optimiseB2.m, /simulation_code/optimiseB4.m for 1,2,4-balloon system seperately.

The optimization records are available in /optimization_process/.
The results of optimized simulator, e.g., trajectories of Bernoulli-Balls, are available in /result_of_simulation/.
